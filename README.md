# Rock Paper Scissors Game

A classic Rock Paper Scissors game built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS as part of The Odin Project curriculum. This interactive web application allows users to play against the computer in a best-of-5 match.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Click on one of the three buttons: Rock, Paper, or Scissors
2. The computer will automatically make its choice
3. The winner of each round is determined by the classic rules:
   - Rock beats Scissors
   - Paper beats Rock
   - Scissors beats Paper
4. First to win 5 rounds wins the game!
5. After the game ends, buttons are disabled until the page is refreshed

## 🛠️ Technologies & Skills Used

### Frontend Technologies
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup for game structure
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Game logic and interactivity
- **DOM Manipulation**: Dynamic content updates

### JavaScript Concepts Demonstrated
- **Event Listeners**: Handling button click events with `addEventListener()`
- **querySelector**: Selecting and manipulating DOM elements
- **Functions**: Modular code organization with `getComputerChoice()`, `getHumanChoice()`, and `playRound()`
- **Conditional Logic**: Game rules implementation with if/else statements
- **Random Number Generation**: Computer choice selection using `Math.random()`
- **String Manipulation**: User input processing with `toLowerCase()`
- **Dynamic DOM Creation**: Creating and appending elements with `createElement()` and `appendChild()`
- **Game State Management**: Score tracking and game flow control

### Programming Concepts
- **Algorithm Design**: Game logic flow and decision trees
- **User Interface Design**: Interactive button-based gameplay
- **Error Handling**: Input validation and game state management
- **Code Organization**: Clean, readable, and maintainable code structure
